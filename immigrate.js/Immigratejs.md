Say hello to everyone.

Thank everyone, including organizers for the opportunity to share some time together.

Today I'd like to share a bit of my story and how I got to be here, in front of you.

Maybe not relevant for many of you, but still want to share it specially for those who are just starting and all of you who are from different countries.

First, huge thanks to my wife!

# 2005

- LAMP and friends ( HTML, CSS 😖, JavaScript 😠 )
- I really, REALLY, hated 🖕 JavaScript 🖕 at the time
  - no jQuery
  - IE6, Firefox 1.5
- XML, XSLT
- C and VB for Palm OS devices
- After 1.5 painful year moved on

???

... landed a position at a company whose development team was mostly outsourced from my home town.

Fun history: Job posting said JavaScript was just a "nice to have", but I ended up having to learn the basics during a test, in their office and most of my tasks where both PHP and JavaScript.

Specially if you are from a different country or speak more than one language, help to generate or translate content; There are lots of really good resources in english, but there is still a lack of the same good resources in other languages, like Spanish.
